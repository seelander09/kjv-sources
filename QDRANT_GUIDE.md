## Doublet Analysis Features

### What are Doublets?
Doublets are occurrences in the Old Testament where a story is told at least two different times by different documentary sources. They provide crucial evidence for the Documentary Hypothesis by showing how different authors approached the same narratives with distinct theological emphases and literary styles.

### Supported Doublets
The system includes comprehensive analysis of 30+ doublets from Genesis through Deuteronomy, including:

#### Genesis Doublets
- **Creation Stories**: P (Gen 1:1-2:3) vs J (Gen 2:4b-25)
- **Genealogies from Adam**: J (Gen 4:17-26) vs P (Gen 5:1-32)
- **Flood Narrative**: Interwoven J and P accounts
- **Wife-Sister Motif**: Three variations across J and E sources
- **Abrahamic Covenant**: J/E/R (Gen 15) vs P (Gen 17)
- **Hagar and Ishmael**: Multiple accounts across J, P, and E

#### Exodus/Numbers Doublets
- **Moses' Commission**: Multiple calling accounts across J, E, and P
- **Ten Commandments**: Three different versions (Exodus 20, 34, Deuteronomy 5)
- **Water from Rock**: E (Exodus 17) vs P (Numbers 20)
- **Manna and Quail**: P (Exodus 16) vs E (Numbers 11)

### Analysis Dimensions
Each doublet is analyzed across multiple dimensions:
- **Source Attribution**: Which documentary sources tell the story
- **Theological Emphasis**: Different theological perspectives in each account
- **Narrative Purpose**: Why each version exists and what it emphasizes
- **Historical Development**: How the tradition developed over time
- **Literary Characteristics**: Distinctive features of each source
- **Redactional Integration**: How the editor combined different versions

### Search Capabilities
- **Category-based search**: Find doublets by narrative type
- **Parallel passage detection**: Automatically find related accounts
- **Theological difference analysis**: Compare theological emphases
- **Source pattern analysis**: Track how sources handle the same stories
- **Hybrid semantic search**: Combine meaning-based search with doublet filtering

## Performance Optimization

### Indexing Strategy
- **Text fields**: Indexed for exact matching
- **Numeric fields**: Range queries supported
- **Array fields**: Multi-value filtering
- **Vector fields**: Semantic similarity search

### Query Optimization
- Use specific filters to reduce search space
- Combine semantic and structured search for best results
- Leverage POV analysis for targeted research

## Integration Examples

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from kjv_sources.qdrant_client import create_qdrant_client

client = create_qdrant_client()

# POV analysis
results = client.search_by_pov_style("narrative_anthropomorphic")
comparison = client.search_pov_comparison("J", "P")
stats = client.get_pov_statistics()
```

### Research Applications
- **Source Criticism**: Compare different documentary sources
- **Redaction Analysis**: Identify editorial patterns
- **POV Analysis**: Understand author perspectives and purposes
- **Theme Research**: Track themes across sources
- **Complexity Analysis**: Study multi-source verses
- **Statistical Analysis**: Quantitative source analysis

### Advanced Features
