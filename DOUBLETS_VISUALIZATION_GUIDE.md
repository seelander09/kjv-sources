# Biblical Doublets Visualization Guide
## Bird's Eye View of Repeated Passages in Scripture

### Overview

This guide provides comprehensive tools and approaches for visualizing biblical doublets (repeated passages) from a bird's eye perspective. Based on extensive research into academic tools, visualization libraries, and biblical scholarship, this project offers multiple visualization approaches to identify patterns and insights in the Documentary Hypothesis.

## üéØ What Are Biblical Doublets?

Biblical doublets are repeated narratives, laws, or themes that appear multiple times in the Bible with variations. These repetitions provide evidence for the Documentary Hypothesis, which proposes that the Torah consists of multiple sources (J, E, P, D, R) that were later combined by redactors.

**Key Examples in Our Dataset:**
- **Creation Stories**: Two different creation accounts (Genesis 1:1-2:3 vs 2:4b-25)
- **Flood Narrative**: Interwoven accounts from J and P sources
- **Wife-Sister Motif**: Three similar deception stories
- **Ten Commandments**: Multiple versions across Exodus and Deuteronomy
