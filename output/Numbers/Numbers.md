- 15:19 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.
- 15:20 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.
- 15:40 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.
- 15:22 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,
- 15:23 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;
- 15:24 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.
- 15:25 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:
- 15:26 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.
- 15:27 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.
- 15:28 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.
- 15:41 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.
- 15:30 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
- 15:42 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.
- 15:32 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.
- 15:33 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.
- 15:34 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.
- 15:35 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
- 15:43 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.
- 15:37 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
- 15:38 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:
- 15:39 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:
- 15:40 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.
- 15:44 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.

## Chapter 16
- 16:1 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,
- 16:2 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:
- 16:45 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?
- 16:4 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:
- 16:5 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.
- 16:6 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
- 16:7 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.
- 16:8 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
- 16:9 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?
- 16:10 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?
- 16:46 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?
- 16:12 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up:
- 16:13 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?
- 16:14 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
- 16:47 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
- 16:16 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:
- 16:17 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.
- 16:18 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.
- 16:19 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.
- 16:20 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
- 16:21 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
- 16:48 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
- 16:23 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
- 16:24 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle
- 16:25 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
- 16:26 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And he spake unto the congregation,
- 16:49 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  So they gat up from the tabernacle
- 16:49 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
- 16:49 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  on every side:
- 16:49 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.
- 16:28 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.
- 16:29 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me.
- 16:30 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.
- 16:31 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:
- 16:32 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses,
- 16:33 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.
- 16:34 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.
- 16:50 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.
- 16:36 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
- 16:37 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.
- 16:38 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
- 16:39 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:
- 16:40 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.
- 16:51 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.
- 16:42 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
- 16:43 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
- 16:44 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
- 16:45 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
- 16:46 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.
- 16:47 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
- 16:48 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
- 16:49 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.
- 16:52 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

## Chapter 17
- 17:1 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
- 17:2 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.
- 17:3 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.
- 17:4 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.
- 17:5 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.
- 17:6 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
- 17:7 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
- 17:8 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.
- 17:9 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
- 17:10 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.
- 17:11 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
- 17:12 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.
- 17:53 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

## Chapter 18
- 18:1 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
- 18:2 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.
- 18:3 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.
- 18:4 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
- 18:5 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.
- 18:6 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
- 18:54 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
- 18:8 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.
- 18:9 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of their's, every meat offering of their's, and every sin offering of their's, and every trespass offering of their's which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
- 18:10 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.
- 18:11 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
- 18:12 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee.
- 18:13 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it.
- 18:14 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
- 18:15 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
- 18:16 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
- 18:17 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.
- 18:18 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine.
- 18:19 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.
- 18:55 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.
- 18:21 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
- 18:22 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.
- 18:23 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
- 18:24 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
- 18:25 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
- 18:26 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.
- 18:27 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.
- 18:28 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.
- 18:29 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.
- 18:30 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.
- 18:31 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.
- 18:56 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.

- 19:2 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:
- 19:3 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:
- 19:4 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:
- 19:5 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
- 19:6 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
- 19:7 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even.
- 19:8 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.
- 19:9 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.
- 19:57 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
- 19:11 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.
- 19:12 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
- 19:13 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
- 19:14 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
- 19:15 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.
- 19:16 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
- 19:17 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:
- 19:18 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:
- 19:19 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.
- 19:20 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
- 19:21 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.
- 19:58 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.

## Chapter 20
- 20:1 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month:
- 20:2 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
- 20:3 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the people chode with Moses, and spake,
- 20:4 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?
- 20:59 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
- 20:6 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.
- 20:7 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
- 20:8 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.
- 20:9 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
- 20:10 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
- 20:11 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.
- 20:12 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.
- 20:60 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.
- 20:14 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:
- 20:15 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:
- 20:16 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:
- 20:17 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
- 20:18 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
- 20:19 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.
- 20:20 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
- 20:61 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
- 20:22 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
- 20:23 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,
- 20:24 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
- 20:25 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:
- 20:26 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.
- 20:27 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
- 20:28 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
- 20:62 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

## Chapter 21
- 21:64 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea,
- 21:64 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
- 21:5 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water;
- 21:6 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
- 21:7 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
- 21:8 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.
- 21:65 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
- 21:10 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
- 21:11 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.
- 21:12 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
- 21:13 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
- 21:14 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
- 21:15 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.
- 21:21 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
- 21:22 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders.
- 21:23 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
- 21:24 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
- 21:25 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
- 21:26 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.

- 27:3 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.
- 27:4 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.

- 27:7 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
- 27:8 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
- 27:9 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.
- 27:10 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren.
- 27:83 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.

- 27:14 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
- 27:15 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,
- 27:16 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,
- 27:17 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.
- 27:18 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;
- 27:19 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
- 27:20 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.
- 27:21 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.
- 27:22 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:
- 27:84 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

- 30:3 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth;
- 30:4 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
- 30:5 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
- 30:6 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;
- 30:7 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
- 30:8 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.
- 30:9 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
- 30:10 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
- 30:11 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
- 30:12 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
- 30:13 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
- 30:14 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
- 30:15 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.
- 30:87 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.

## Chapter 31
- 31:1 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
- 31:2 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
- 31:3 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.
- 31:4 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
- 31:5 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
- 31:88 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
- 31:7 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.
- 31:8 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian:
- 31:9 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
- 31:10 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.
- 31:11 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.
- 31:89 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.
- 31:13 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
- 31:14 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.
- 31:15 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses said unto them,
- 31:16 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.
- 31:17 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
- 31:90 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
- 31:19 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
- 31:20 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.
- 31:21 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;
- 31:22 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
- 31:23 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.
- 31:91 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
- 31:25 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
- 31:26 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:
- 31:27 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:
- 31:28 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:
- 31:29 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.
- 31:30 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.
- 31:31 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
- 31:32 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
- 31:33 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,
- 31:34 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And threescore and one thousand asses,
- 31:35 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And thirty and two thousand persons in all,
- 31:36 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:
- 31:37 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
- 31:38 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and twelve.
- 31:39 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and one.
- 31:40 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was thirty and two persons.
- 31:41 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.
- 31:42 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,
- 31:43 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
- 31:44 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And thirty and six thousand beeves,
- 31:45 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
- 31:46 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And sixteen thousand persons;)
- 31:47 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
- 31:48 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:
- 31:49 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
- 31:50 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.
- 31:51 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.
- 31:52 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
- 31:53 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
- 31:92 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.

## Chapter 32
- 32:1 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;
- 32:2 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,
- 32:3 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
- 32:4 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:
- 32:93 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight,
- 32:93 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession,
- 32:93 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  and
- 32:93 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  bring us not over Jordan.
- 32:6 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?
- 32:7 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?
- 32:8 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.
- 32:9 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.
- 32:10 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,
- 32:11 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
- 32:12 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.
- 32:13 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.
- 32:14 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.
- 32:94 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.
- 32:16 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
- 32:17 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place:
- 32:18 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
- 32:19 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.
- 32:20 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Moses said unto them,  If ye will do this thing,
- 32:21 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,
- 32:22 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return,
- 32:23 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.
- 32:24 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.
- 32:25 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.
- 32:26 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:
- 32:27 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the Lord to battle, as my lord saith.
- 32:28 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:
- 32:29 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:
- 32:30 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

- 35:13 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge.
- 35:14 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.
- 35:102 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.
- 35:16 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
- 35:17 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
- 35:18 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
- 35:19 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.
- 35:20 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;
- 35:103 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.
- 35:22 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,
- 35:23 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
- 35:24 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:
- 35:25 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.
- 35:26 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;
- 35:27 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:
- 35:104 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
- 35:29 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
- 35:30 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.
- 35:31 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.
- 35:32 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
- 35:33 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
- 35:105 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

- 36:2 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.
- 36:3 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
- 36:4 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
- 36:5 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.
- 36:6 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
- 36:7 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

- 36:9 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
- 36:10 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
- 36:11 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons:
- 36:12 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
- 36:106 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
