## Chapter 1
- 1:15 **J** And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:
- 1:16 **J** And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
- 1:17 **J** But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.
- 1:18 **J** And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?
- 1:19 **J** And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.
- 1:20 **J** Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
- 1:21 **J** And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
- 1:22 **J** And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

## Chapter 2
- 2:1 **J** And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
- 2:2 **J** And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
- 2:3 **J** And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.
- 2:4 **J** And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
- 2:5 **J** And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
- 2:6 **J** And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.
- 2:7 **J** Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
- 2:8 **J** And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.
- 2:9 **J** And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.
- 2:10 **J** And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.

## Chapter 3
- 3:1 **J + P** Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.
- 3:4 **J + P** God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
- 3:6 **J** Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
- 3:9 **J** behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
- 3:10 **J** Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
- 3:11 **J** And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
- 3:12 **J** And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
- 3:13 **J** And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
- 3:14 **J** And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.
- 3:15 **J** And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

- 4:18 **J** And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
- 4:21 **P** And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.
- 4:22 **P** And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:
- 4:23 **P** And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.

## Chapter 10
- 10:1 **P** for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:
- 10:2 **P** And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.

## Chapter 13
- 13:1 **P** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
- 13:2 **P** Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.
- 13:3 **P** And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
- 13:4 **P** This day came ye out in the month Abib.
- 13:5 **P** And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
- 13:6 **P** Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.
- 13:7 **P** Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.
- 13:8 **P** And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.
- 13:9 **P** And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.
- 13:10 **P** Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.
- 13:11 **P** And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,
- 13:12 **P** That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.
- 13:13 **P** And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
- 13:14 **P** And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
- 13:15 **P** And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.
- 13:16 **P** And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.
- 13:18 **J + P** of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

- 15:21 **J** And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

## Chapter 17
- 17:8 **J** Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
- 17:9 **J** And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.
- 17:10 **J** So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
- 17:11 **J** And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
- 17:12 **J** But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
- 17:13 **J** And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
- 17:14 **J** And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
- 17:15 **J** And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:
- 17:16 **J** For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

## Chapter 18
- 18:1 **J** When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;
- 18:2 **J + P** Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,
- 18:3 **P** And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:
- 18:4 **P** And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:
- 18:5 **J + P** And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:
- 18:6 **J** And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
- 18:7 **J** And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.
- 18:8 **J** And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.
- 18:9 **J** And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
- 18:10 **J** And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
- 18:11 **J** Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.
- 18:12 **J** And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.
- 18:13 **J** And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.
- 18:14 **J** And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?
- 18:15 **J** And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:
- 18:16 **J** When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
- 18:17 **J** And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
- 18:18 **J** Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
- 18:19 **J** Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:
- 18:20 **J** And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
- 18:21 **J** Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
- 18:22 **J** And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.
- 18:23 **J** If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
- 18:24 **J** So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.
- 18:25 **J** And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
- 18:26 **J** And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
- 18:27 **J** And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.

## Chapter 19
- 19:2 **J** and there Israel camped before the mount.
- 19:3 **J** And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;
- 19:4 **J** Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.
- 19:5 **J** Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:
- 19:6 **J** And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.
- 19:7 **J** And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.
- 19:8 **J** And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.
- 19:9 **J** And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever.
- 19:16 **J** there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.
- 19:17 **J** And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
- 19:18 **P** And
- 19:19 **J** And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.

## Chapter 20
- 20:1 **P** And God spake all these words, saying,
- 20:2 **P** I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
- 20:3 **P** Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
- 20:4 **P** Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
- 20:5 **P** Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;
- 20:6 **P** And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
- 20:7 **P** Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
- 20:8 **P** Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
- 20:9 **P** Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:
- 20:10 **P** But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
- 20:11 **P** For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
- 20:12 **P** Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
- 20:13 **P** Thou shalt not kill.
- 20:14 **P** Thou shalt not commit adultery.
- 20:15 **P** Thou shalt not steal.
- 20:16 **P** Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
- 20:17 **P** Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.
- 20:18 **J** And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.
- 20:19 **J** And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
- 20:20 **J** And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
- 20:21 **J** And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
- 20:22 **J** And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
- 20:23 **J** Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.
- 20:24 **J** An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.
- 20:25 **J** And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
- 20:26 **J** Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.

## Chapter 21
- 21:1 **J** Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
- 21:2 **J** If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
- 21:3 **J** If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.
- 21:4 **J** If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.
- 21:5 **J** And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
- 21:6 **J** Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.
- 21:7 **J** And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.
- 21:8 **J** If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
- 21:9 **J** And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
- 21:10 **J** If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
- 21:11 **J** And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.
- 21:12 **J** He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.
- 21:13 **J** And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
- 21:14 **J** But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.
- 21:15 **J** And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
- 21:16 **J** And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
- 21:17 **J** And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
- 21:18 **J** And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:
- 21:19 **J** If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
- 21:20 **J** And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.
- 21:21 **J** Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.
- 21:22 **J** If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
- 21:23 **J** And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
- 21:24 **J** Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
- 21:25 **J** Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
- 21:26 **J** And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.
- 21:27 **J** And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.
- 21:28 **J** If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.
- 21:29 **J** But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.
- 21:30 **J** If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.
- 21:31 **J** Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.
- 21:32 **J** If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
- 21:33 **J** And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;
- 21:34 **J** The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.
- 21:35 **J** And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.
- 21:36 **J** Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.

## Chapter 22
- 22:1 **J** If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
- 22:2 **J** If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.
- 22:3 **J** If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
- 22:4 **J** If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.
- 22:5 **J** If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.
- 22:6 **J** If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
- 22:7 **J** If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.
- 22:8 **J** If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.
- 22:9 **J** For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.
- 22:10 **J** If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:
- 22:11 **J** Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.
- 22:12 **J** And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.
- 22:13 **J** If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.
- 22:14 **J** And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.
- 22:15 **J** But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.
- 22:16 **J** And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.
- 22:17 **J** If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
- 22:18 **J** Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
- 22:19 **J** Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.
- 22:20 **J** He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.
- 22:21 **J** Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
- 22:22 **J** Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
- 22:23 **J** If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;
- 22:24 **J** And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
- 22:25 **J** If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,  thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.
- 22:26 **J** If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:
- 22:27 **J** For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.
- 22:28 **J** Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.
- 22:29 **J** Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.
- 22:30 **J** Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.
- 22:31 **J** And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.

## Chapter 23
- 23:1 **J** Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
- 23:2 **J** Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:
- 23:3 **J** Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.
- 23:4 **J** If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
- 23:5 **J** If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.
- 23:6 **J** Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.
- 23:7 **J** Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
- 23:8 **J** And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
- 23:9 **J** Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
- 23:10 **J** And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:
- 23:11 **J** But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.
- 23:12 **J** Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.
- 23:13 **J** And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
- 23:14 **J** Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.
- 23:15 **J + P** Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)
- 23:16 **J** And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.
- 23:17 **J + P** Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the LORD God.
- 23:18 **J** Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.
- 23:19 **J** The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
- 23:20 **J** Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
- 23:21 **J** Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.
- 23:22 **J** But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
- 23:23 **J** For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.
- 23:24 **J** Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.
- 23:25 **J** And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
- 23:26 **J** There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.
- 23:27 **J** I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
- 23:28 **J** And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.
- 23:29 **J** I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.
- 23:30 **J** By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.
- 23:31 **J** And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
- 23:32 **J** Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
- 23:33 **J** They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.

- 24:5 **J** And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD.
- 24:6 **J** And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

- 24:11 **J** and did eat and drink.
- 24:12 **J + P** And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.
- 24:13 **J** And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.
- 24:14 **J** And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.
- 24:15 **J** And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.
- 24:18 **J** and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.

## Chapter 32
- 32:1 **J** And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
- 32:2 **J** And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.
- 32:3 **J** And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.
- 32:4 **J** And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
- 32:5 **J** And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.
- 32:6 **J** And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
- 32:7 **J** And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:
- 32:8 **J** They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
- 32:9 **P** And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:
- 32:10 **P** Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
- 32:11 **P** And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?
- 32:12 **P** Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
- 32:13 **P** Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.
- 32:14 **P** And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.
- 32:15 **J + P** And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
- 32:16 **J** And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
- 32:17 **J** And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
- 32:18 **J** And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.
- 32:19 **J** And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.
- 32:20 **J** And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
- 32:21 **J** And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?
- 32:22 **J** And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.
- 32:23 **J** For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
- 32:24 **J** And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
- 32:25 **P** (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)
- 32:30 **J** And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.
- 32:31 **J** And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
- 32:32 **J** Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
- 32:33 **J** And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
- 32:34 **J** Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.
- 32:35 **P** And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.

- 33:6 **J** by the mount Horeb.
- 33:7 **J** And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.

- 33:9 **J** And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.
- 33:10 **J** And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.
- 33:11 **J** And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.

- 34:10 **P** And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.
- 34:11 **P** Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
- 34:12 **P** Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
- 34:13 **P** But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:
- 34:14 **P** For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
- 34:15 **P** Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;
- 34:16 **P** And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.
- 34:17 **P** Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
- 34:18 **P** The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.
- 34:19 **P** All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.
- 34:20 **P** But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All  the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
- 34:21 **P** Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
- 34:22 **P** And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.
- 34:23 **P** Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.
- 34:24 **P** For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.
- 34:25 **P** Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.
- 34:26 **P** The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
