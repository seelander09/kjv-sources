- 20:4 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?
- 20:5 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.
- 20:6 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
- 20:7 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.

- 20:9 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
- 20:10 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
- 20:11 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
- 20:12 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
- 20:13 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
- 20:14 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.

- 21:55 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.
- 21:8 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
- 21:9 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
- 21:10 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
- 21:11 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
- 21:12 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
- 21:13 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
- 21:14 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
- 21:15 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
- 21:16 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
- 21:17 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
- 21:18 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
- 21:19 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
- 21:20 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
- 21:56 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

- 21:57 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.

- 22:8 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
- 22:9 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

- 22:13 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
- 22:58 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.

- 31:23 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
- 31:24 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
- 31:25 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.
- 31:26 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?
- 31:27 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
- 31:28 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
- 31:29 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight,  saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
- 31:30 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
- 31:31 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
- 31:32 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
- 31:33 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
- 31:34 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.
- 31:35 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.
- 31:36 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
- 31:37 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
- 31:38 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
- 31:39 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.
- 31:40 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.
- 31:41 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
- 31:42 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
- 31:43 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?
- 31:44 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
- 31:45 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
- 31:46 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.
- 31:47 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
- 31:84 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;
- 31:85 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
- 31:50 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
- 31:51 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:
- 31:52 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
- 31:53 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.
- 31:84 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
- 31:86 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.

## Chapter 32
- 32:1 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
- 32:86 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host:
- 32:86 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
- 32:27 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
- 32:88 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God
- 32:88 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  and with men, and hast prevailed.
- 32:29 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?
- 32:88 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
- 32:88 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  as he passed over Penuel

## Chapter 33
- 33:90 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem,
- 33:90 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram;
- 33:90 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  and pitched his tent before the city
- 33:19 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.
- 33:90 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.

## Chapter 34
- 34:91 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her,
- 34:3 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
- 34:91 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
- 34:91 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
- 34:8 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.
- 34:9 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
- 34:10 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
- 34:11 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
- 34:12 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
- 34:91 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully,
- 34:91 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
- 34:14 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:
- 34:15 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;
- 34:16 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
- 34:17 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
- 34:18 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
- 34:19 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.
- 34:20 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
- 34:21 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
- 34:22 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
- 34:23 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
- 34:24 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
- 34:91 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,
- 34:91 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
- 34:91 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
- 34:91 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  because they had defiled their sister.
- 34:28 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,
- 34:91 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.

## Chapter 35
- 35:93 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  So Jacob came to Luz,
- 35:93 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
- 35:9 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.
- 35:10 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
- 35:11 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
- 35:12 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
- 35:94 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And God went up from him
- 35:94 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  in the place where he talked with him.
- 35:94 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  in the place where he talked with him,
- 35:94 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.
- 35:95 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath:
- 35:95 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.
- 35:17 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.
- 35:95 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.
- 35:95 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
- 35:95 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
- 35:95 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
- 35:23 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:
- 35:24 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:
- 35:25 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:
- 35:95 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.
- 35:27 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
- 35:28 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
- 35:96 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.

## Chapter 36
- 36:1 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.
- 36:2 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
- 36:3 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
- 36:4 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;
- 36:5 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
- 36:6 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.

## Chapter 37
- 37:1 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
- 37:98 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  These are the generations of Jacob.
- 37:98 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.
- 37:98 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  but his father observed the saying.
- 37:12 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
- 37:13 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
- 37:99 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of
- 37:99 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  Hebron,
- 37:99 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  and he came to Shechem.
- 37:15 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
- 37:16 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.
- 37:99 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
- 37:100 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
- 37:21 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.
- 37:100 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.
- 37:24 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
- 37:100 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And they sat down to eat bread:
- 37:100 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit,
- 37:29 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
- 37:100 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?
- 37:100 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

## Chapter 39
- 39:103 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard,

## Chapter 40
- 40:1 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
- 40:2 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
- 40:105 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,
- 40:105 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
- 40:105 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.
- 40:106 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt,
- 40:106 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  which were bound in the prison.
- 40:6 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.
- 40:7 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?
- 40:8 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.
- 40:9 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
- 40:10 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
- 40:11 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
- 40:12 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:
- 40:13 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
- 40:14 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
- 40:106 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:
- 40:106 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
- 40:16 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:
- 40:17 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
- 40:18 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:
- 40:19 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
- 40:20 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
- 40:21 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
- 40:22 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
- 40:106 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

## Chapter 41
- 41:1 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
- 41:2 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
- 41:3 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.
- 41:4 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
- 41:5 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
- 41:6 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
- 41:7 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
- 41:8 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
- 41:9 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
- 41:10 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:
- 41:11 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
- 41:12 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
- 41:107 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
- 41:14 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
- 41:15 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
- 41:16 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
- 41:17 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
- 41:18 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
- 41:19 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
- 41:20 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
- 41:21 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
- 41:22 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
- 41:23 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
- 41:24 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
- 41:25 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
- 41:26 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
- 41:27 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
- 41:28 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
- 41:29 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
- 41:30 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
- 41:31 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
- 41:32 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
- 41:33 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
- 41:34 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
- 41:35 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
- 41:108 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
- 41:37 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
- 41:38 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
- 41:39 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
- 41:109 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
- 41:44 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
- 41:109 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.
- 41:109 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt.
- 41:109 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
- 41:47 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
- 41:48 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
- 41:49 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.
- 41:110 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came,
- 41:110 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
- 41:51 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
- 41:110 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
- 41:53 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
- 41:111 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said:
- 41:111 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
- 41:111 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
- 41:111 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  to Joseph

## Chapter 46
- 46:1 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.

- 46:3 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:
- 46:4 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

- 48:122 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.
- 48:8 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

- 48:10 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
- 48:11 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.
- 48:12 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.

- 48:14 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
- 48:15 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
- 48:16 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
- 48:17 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.
- 48:18 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
- 48:122 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
- 48:122 `P` ![#888888](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888888/000000?text=+)  And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless,
- 48:122 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
- 48:21 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
- 48:122 `E` ![#000088](https://via.placeholder.com/12/000088/000000?text=+)  Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
