- 4:17 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,
- 4:18 `E` ![#888800](https://via.placeholder.com/12/888800/000000?text=+)  The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:
