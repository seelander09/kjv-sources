According to the <a href="w:documentary_hypothesis" class="wikilink"
title="documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a>, the
<a href="w:Torah" class="wikilink" title="Torah">Torah</a> is composed
from a number of originally independant sources joined by a
<a href="w:redaction" class="wikilink" title="redactor">redactor</a>.
One of these supposed sources is named the
<a href="w:Deuteronomist" class="wikilink"
title="&quot;Deuteronomist&quot;">"Deuteronomist"</a>, due to it
composing the vast majority of the text of
<a href="w:Deuteronomy" class="wikilink"
title="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a>. Under the usual form of the
hypothesis, the deuteronomist text is believed to have come in two
editions, the earlier one, known as "Dtr1", being written around the
time of king
<a href="w:Josiah" class="wikilink" title="Josiah">Josiah</a> by someone
from the same circle as
<a href="w:Jeremiah" class="wikilink" title="Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>.

Though considered to have been written as a coherent work by a single
author, the text can be broken down into a number of components,
including a set of curses (deuteronomy 28:16-19) and a symetrical set of
blessings (deuteronomy 28:3-6). These may be the set of curses referred
to nearby in the text to be shouted by one half of the tribes from Mount
<a href="w:Ebal" class="wikilink" title="Ebal">Ebal</a>, and the set of
blessings to be simultaneously shouted from Mount
<a href="w:Gerizim" class="wikilink" title="Gerizim">Gerizim</a>. They
may originate in an oral tradition, or a separate document.

*The numbering does not necessarily reflect that in the original in any
way, but is simply present for ease of reference for the modern reader*

## Blessings

Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the
field.

Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and
the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy
sheep.

Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be
when thou goest out.

## Curses

Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.

Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.

Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the
increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when
thou goest out.
