The [[w:Holiness Code|Holiness code]] is a portion of the text of [[w:Leviticus|Leviticus]] considered as a distinct entity due to its highly repeated use of the term "holy". In the [[w:documentary hypothesis|documentary hypothesis]], it is considered part of the [[w:Priestly source|Priestly source]], although as an originally separate text (known to scholars as "H"), embodied in the Priestly source by the Priestly source's writer.

It appears at Leviticus 17-26, excepting 
*the occasional introductory passages ("And God spoke unto to Moses, speak unto ...")
*references to the [[w:tabernacle|tabernacle]]
*references to anointing oil, and the head of the high priest
*Leviticus 23:1-10a (reference to [[w:passover|passover]], and the [[w:sabbath|sabbath]])
*Leviticus 23:23-44 (reference to the feasts of the seventh month)
*Leviticus 24:1-15a (reference to an incident of [[w:blasphemy|blasphemy]])
*Leviticus 24:23 (reference to the stoning of a blasphemer)
*Leviticus 25:9b (reference to the [[w:Yom Kippur]])
*Leviticus 25:23 and 25:26-34 (reference to land reverting to its original owner)
*Leviticus 25:40, 25:42, 25:44-46, 25:48-52, and 25:54 (reference to only the [[w:heathen|heathen]] being allowed as [[w:slavery|slaves]])
*Leviticus 26:39-46 (reference to return from exile)

Outside the documentary hypothesis, the term "holiness code" is often used to refer to the whole of Leviticus 17-26. It is believed that the holiness code is a complition of laws collected from elsewhere. However, two portions of the holiness code, concerning sexual prohibitions, are believed to have been derived from a previous collection.

*The list of sexual prohibitions, which is highlighted in {{font|color=#000088|navy blue}} <small>{{font|color=#0000FF|([[Bible, English, King James, Documentary Hypothesis, Priestly source, Holiness Code, Sexual Prohibitions|View in isolation]])}}</small>
