According to the [[w:documentary hypothesis|documentary hypothesis]], the [[w:Torah|Torah]] is composed from a number of originally independent sources joined by a [[w:redaction|redactor]]. One of these supposed sources is named the [[w:Jahwist|"Jahwist source"]], due to its preference of referring to God as [[w:Jahweh|Jahweh]] (usually translated as "The LORD"). This source contains within it two poems which are believed to have originally been separate documents. One of these poems (at Exodus 15:1b-18) is known as the [[w:Song of the Sea|Song of the Sea]]. The first two lines of the poem also appear in the text ascribed to the [[w:Elohist|Elohist source]] (at Exodus 15:1b), and it may be the case that the Elohist source originally contained the full poem, it being truncated by the redactor.
