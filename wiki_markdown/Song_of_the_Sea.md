According to the <a href="w:documentary_hypothesis" class="wikilink"
title="documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a>, the
<a href="w:Torah" class="wikilink" title="Torah">Torah</a> is composed
from a number of originally independent sources joined by a
<a href="w:redaction" class="wikilink" title="redactor">redactor</a>.
One of these supposed sources is named the
<a href="w:Jahwist" class="wikilink"
title="&quot;Jahwist source&quot;">"Jahwist source"</a>, due to its
preference of referring to God as
<a href="w:Jahweh" class="wikilink" title="Jahweh">Jahweh</a> (usually
translated as "The LORD"). This source contains within it two poems
which are believed to have originally been separate documents. One of
these poems (at Exodus 15:1b-18) is known as the
<a href="w:Song_of_the_Sea" class="wikilink"
title="Song of the Sea">Song of the Sea</a>. The first two lines of the
poem also appear in the text ascribed to the
<a href="w:Elohist" class="wikilink" title="Elohist source">Elohist
source</a> (at Exodus 15:1b), and it may be the case that the Elohist
source originally contained the full poem, it being truncated by the
redactor.

*Although the text is ordered as it appears in the bible, the numbering
does not reflect, in any way, the original numbering of the text, and
simply exists for the ease of modern readership*
