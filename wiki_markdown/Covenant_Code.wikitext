According to the [[w:documentary hypothesis|documentary hypothesis]], the [[w:Torah|Torah]] is composed from a number of originally independant sources joined by a [[w:redaction|redactor]]. One of these supposed sources is named the [[w:Elohist|"Elohist source"]], due to its preference of referring to God as [[w:El (god)|El]] or as Elohim (both usually translated as "God"). Rather than the [[w:Ten commandments|Ten commandments]] present in the [[w:Jahwist|Jahwist source]], the Elohist text contains a law code (at Exodus 21:2 - 23:33), which is believed to have been an originally separate document, known as the [[w:Covenant Code|Covenant Code]].

''Although the text is ordered as it appears in the bible, the numbering does not reflect, in any way, the original numbering of the text, and simply exists for the ease of modern readership''
