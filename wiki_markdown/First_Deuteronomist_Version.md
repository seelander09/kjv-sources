According to the <a href="w:documentary_hypothesis" class="wikilink"
title="documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a>, the
<a href="w:Torah" class="wikilink" title="Torah">Torah</a> is composed
from a number of originally independent sources joined by a
<a href="w:redaction" class="wikilink" title="redactor">redactor</a>.
One of these supposed sources is named the
<a href="w:Deuteronomist" class="wikilink"
title="&quot;Deuteronomist&quot;">"Deuteronomist"</a>, due to it
composing the vast majority of the text of
<a href="w:Deuteronomy" class="wikilink"
title="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a>. Under the usual form of the
hypothesis, the deuteronomist text is believed to have come in two
editions, the earlier one, known as "Dtr1", being written around the
time of king
<a href="w:Josiah" class="wikilink" title="Josiah">Josiah</a> by someone
from the same circle as
<a href="w:Jeremiah" class="wikilink" title="Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>.

There follows the reconstructed text of the original edition ("dtr1") of
the deuteronomist source of the Torah, using the
<a href="w:King_James_Version" class="wikilink"
title="King James Translation">King James Translation</a>.

Though considered to have been written as a coherent work by a single
author, the text can be broken down into a number of components, some of
which may derive from separate documents or observations.
