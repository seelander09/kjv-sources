According to the <a href="w:documentary_hypothesis" class="wikilink"
title="documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a>, the
<a href="w:Torah" class="wikilink" title="Torah">Torah</a> is composed
from a number of originally independant sources joined by a
<a href="w:redaction" class="wikilink" title="redactor">redactor</a>.
One of these supposed sources is named the
<a href="w:Deuteronomist" class="wikilink"
title="&quot;Deuteronomist&quot;">"Deuteronomist"</a>, due to it
composing the vast majority of the text of
<a href="w:Deuteronomy" class="wikilink"
title="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a>. Under the usual form of the
hypothesis, the deuteronomist text is believed to have come in two
editions, the earlier one, known as "Dtr1", being written around the
time of king
<a href="w:Josiah" class="wikilink" title="Josiah">Josiah</a> by someone
from the same circle as
<a href="w:Jeremiah" class="wikilink" title="Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>.

Though considered to have been written as a coherent work by a single
author, the text can be broken down into a number of components,
including a list of curses to be shouted by priests from Mount
<a href="w:Ebal" class="wikilink" title="Ebal">Ebal</a>, occuring at
deuteronomy 27:15-26. The list of curses may originate in an oral
tradition, and appears to exhibit a connection to the
<a href="w:Ten_commandments" class="wikilink"
title="Ten commandments">Ten commandments</a>.

way, but is simply present for ease of reference for the modern reader*
