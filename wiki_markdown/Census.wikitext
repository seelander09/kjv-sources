<[[Bible, English, King James, According to the documentary hypothesis]] | [[Bible, English, King James, Documentary Hypothesis, Priestly source|Priestly source]]

According to the [[w:documentary hypothesis|documentary hypothesis]], the [[w:torah|torah]] was redacted together from a number of earlier source texts. The largest of these is referred to as the "[[w:Priestly source|Priestly source]]", due to its concentration on details which would be of interest to the [[w:Aaron|Aaron]]id priesthood. 

The reconstructed text of this source contains several elements which are separable from the narrative, including several laws, and descriptions of how rituals should be carried out. It is sometimes believed that these were originally separate documents held as priestly records, or simple observations. One of these separable elements is the census data listing the numbers of each tribe and its princes, at different points. 

Some of the data appears as the first census at [[w:Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1:2-48, 1:54, 2:1-16, 2:17b-34, 3:15-24, 3:27-30, 3:33-35, 3:38-40, 3:42-51, 4:1-3, 4:22-23, 4:29-30, and 4:34-49. More information about names of leaders occurs at Numbers 10:14-16, 10:18-20, 10:22-27, and 13:3b-16a. The remainder of the data, including the genealogies of families, appears as the second census at Numbers 26:1-8 and 26:12-65.

''Though based on the relevant passages of Numbers, the following text presents the information in a simplified form, while keeping the same data. The numbering of the text does not necessarily reflect that of the original''
