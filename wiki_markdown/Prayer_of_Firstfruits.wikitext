According to the [[w:documentary hypothesis|documentary hypothesis]], the [[w:Torah|Torah]] is composed from a number of originally independant sources joined by a [[w:redaction|redactor]]. One of these supposed sources is named the [[w:Deuteronomist|"Deuteronomist"]], due to it composing the vast majority of the text of [[w:Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]. Under the usual form of the hypothesis, the deuteronomist text is believed to have come in two editions, the earlier one, known as "Dtr1", being written around the time of king [[w:Josiah|Josiah]] by someone from the same circle as [[w:Jeremiah|Jeremiah]].

Though considered to have been written as a coherent work by a single author, the text can be broken down into a number of components, including two prayers, which may originate in an oral tradition, or separate document. One of these prayers concerns the [[w:Harvest|Firstfruits]], and occurs at Deuteronomy 26:5b-10a.

''The numbering does not necessarily reflect that in the original in any way, but is simply present for ease of reference for the modern reader''

==Prayer of firstfruits==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}} A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt,

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}} And sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}} And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}} And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice,

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}} And looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression:

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}} And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm,

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}} And with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders:

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}} And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}} And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me.
