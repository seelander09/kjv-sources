According to the <a href="w:documentary_hypothesis" class="wikilink"
title="documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a>, the
<a href="w:Torah" class="wikilink" title="Torah">Torah</a> is composed
from a number of originally independant sources joined by a
<a href="w:redaction" class="wikilink" title="redactor">redactor</a>.
One of these supposed sources is named the
<a href="w:Deuteronomist" class="wikilink"
title="&quot;Deuteronomist&quot;">"Deuteronomist"</a>, due to it
composing the vast majority of the text of
<a href="w:Deuteronomy" class="wikilink"
title="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a>. Under the usual form of the
hypothesis, the deuteronomist text is believed to have come in two
editions, the earlier one, known as "Dtr1", being written around the
time of king
<a href="w:Josiah" class="wikilink" title="Josiah">Josiah</a> by someone
from the same circle as
<a href="w:Jeremiah" class="wikilink" title="Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>.

Though considered to have been written as a coherent work by a single
author, the text can be broken down into a number of components,
including two prayers, which may originate in an oral tradition, or
separate document. One of these prayers concerns the
<a href="w:Tithe" class="wikilink" title="Tithe">Tithe</a>, and occurs
at Deuteronomy 26:13b-15.

*The numbering does not necessarily reflect that in the original in any
way, but is simply present for ease of reference for the modern reader*

## Tithe prayer

I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house,

And also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the
fatherless, and to the widow,

According to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me:

I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.

I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought
thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead:

But I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done
according to all that thou hast commanded me.

Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people
Israel, and the land which thou hast given us,

As thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and
honey.
