According to the <a href="w:documentary_hypothesis" class="wikilink"
title="documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a>, the
<a href="w:torah" class="wikilink" title="torah">torah</a> was redacted
together from a number of earlier source texts. The largest of these is
referred to as the "<a href="w:Priestly_source" class="wikilink"
title="Priestly source">Priestly source</a>", due to its concentration
on details which would be of interest to the
<a href="w:Aaron" class="wikilink" title="Aaron">Aaronid</a> priesthood.

The reconstructed text of this source contains several elements which
are separable from the narrative, including several laws, and
descriptions of how rituals should be carried out. It is sometimes
believed that these were originally separate documents held as priestly
records, or simple observations. One of these separable elements is the
census data listing the numbers of each tribe and its princes, at
different points.

Some of the data appears as the first census at
<a href="w:Book_of_Numbers" class="wikilink" title="Numbers">Numbers</a>
1:2-48, 1:54, 2:1-16, 2:17b-34, 3:15-24, 3:27-30, 3:33-35, 3:38-40,
3:42-51, 4:1-3, 4:22-23, 4:29-30, and 4:34-49. More information about
names of leaders occurs at Numbers 10:14-16, 10:18-20, 10:22-27, and
13:3b-16a. The remainder of the data, including the genealogies of
families, appears as the second census at Numbers 26:1-8 and 26:12-65.

*Though based on the relevant passages of Numbers, the following text
presents the information in a simplified form, while keeping the same
data. The numbering of the text does not necessarily reflect that of the
original*

## Introduction

Of all the congregation of the children of Israel,

  
In the wilderness of Sinai,

<!-- -->

  
  
Take ye the sum,

<!-- -->

  
  
By their generations, after their families, by the house of their
fathers,

<!-- -->

  
  
With the number of their names, every male by their polls;

<!-- -->

  
  
From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war
in Israel.

<!-- -->

  
  
And there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of
his fathers.

<!-- -->

  
  
These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of
their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.

<!-- -->

  
  
Every man of the children of Israel pitched by his own standard, with
the ensign of their father's house:

<!-- -->

  
And in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho,

<!-- -->

  
  
Take the sum,

<!-- -->

  
  
From twenty years old and upward,

<!-- -->

  
  
Throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in
Israel.

<!-- -->

  
  
And there shall be one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by
inheritance

<!-- -->

  
  
Save Rueben, and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for they have
received their inheritance.

These were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and
Merari.

  
Of the children of Levi, number them:

<!-- -->

  
  
After their families, by the house of their fathers:

<!-- -->

  
  
Every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.

<!-- -->

  
And take their sum

<!-- -->

  
  
After their families, by the house of their fathers;

<!-- -->

  
  
From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou
number them,

<!-- -->

  
  
Every one that entereth into the service, to do the work of the
tabernacle of the congregation.
