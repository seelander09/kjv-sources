==Abraham's wife as his sister==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: In the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; For I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? And what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all who hear will laugh with me.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| In all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#000000| And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.}}

==Conflict with Abimelech at Beersheba==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.}}

==The sacrifice of Isaac==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and I shall come again to you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.}}

{{font|11|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.|color=#000000}}

{{font|12|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.|color=#000000}}

{{font|13|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.|color=#000000}}

{{font|14|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.|color=#000000}}

==Jacob's ladder==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.}}

==The stones of Galeed==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#000000| Whereas thou hast searched all my things, what hast thou found of all thy household things? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#000000| This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#000000| That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; Of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#000000| Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#000000| Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#000000| Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#000000| Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|31}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|32}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|33}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|34}}{{font|color=#000000| If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|35}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|36}}{{font|color=#000000| This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|37}}{{font|color=#000000| The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|38}}{{font|color=#000000| Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|39}}{{font|color=#000000| And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.}}

==Jacob is Named Israel==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.|color=#000000}}

==Negotiation with Hamor Over Dinah==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, and pitched his tent before the city.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully,|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.|color=#000000}}

{{font|17|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.|color=#000000}}

{{font|18|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.|color=#000000}}

{{font|19|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,|color=#000000}}

{{font|20|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.|color=#000000}}

{{font|21|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.|color=#000000}}

{{font|22|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.|color=#000000}}

{{font|23|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.|color=#000000}}

{{font|24|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, [they] came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.|color=#000000}}

==The birth of Benjamin==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000|And Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.}}

==Joseph enslaved==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report, but his father observed the saying.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of [the place], and he came to Shechem.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And they sat down to eat bread.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| There passed by some Midianite merchantmen; and they drew and lifted Joseph up out of the pit.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not there; and I, whither shall I go?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000|And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.}}

==The butler and the baker ==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass after these things, that the servant of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000|And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#000000| And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#000000| But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#000000| Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgat him.}}

==Pharaoh's dreams==

{{font|1|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.|color=#000000}}

{{font|2|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.|color=#000000}}

{{font|3|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.|color=#000000}}

{{font|4|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.|color=#000000}}

{{font|5|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.|color=#000000}}

{{font|6|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.|color=#000000}}

{{font|7|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.|color=#000000}}

{{font|8|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.|color=#000000}}

{{font|9|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:|color=#000000}}

==Israel's migration to Egypt==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:}}

==Ephraim's pre-eminence==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000|Saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.}}

==The death of Joseph==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000|And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000|And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put into a coffin in Egypt.}}

==The baby in the reeds ==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000|And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.}}

==Revelation of the Divine Name==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000|God called unto him out of the midst of the [mountain] and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000|[And God said], Behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000|Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:}} 

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#000000| So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#000000| And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#000000| And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#000000| And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.}}

==The arrival at Sinai==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000|And there Israel camped before the mount. And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|And there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.}}

==The Covenant Code==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000|And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|10|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|11|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|12|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|13|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|14|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|15|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|16|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.|color=#000000}}

==The heresy of Peor ==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Israel abode in Shittim, and Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baalpeor.}}

==The Allocation of Gilead ==

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|1}}</small>{{font|color=#000000|Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;}}

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|2}}</small>{{font|color=#000000|[And they said unto Moses], Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:}}

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|3}}</small>{{font|Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, bring us not over Jordan.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|4}}</small>{{font|color=#000000| But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place:}}

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|5}}</small>{{font|color=#000000| We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.}}

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|6}}</small>{{font|color=#000000| For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.}}

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|7}}</small>{{font|color=#000000| And Moses said unto them, if ye will do this thing, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel;}} 

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|8}}</small>{{font|But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|9}}</small>{{font|And Moses gave unto them the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|10}}</small>{{font|And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|11}}</small>{{font|And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|12}}</small>{{font|And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|color=#0000FF|13}}</small>{{font|And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.|color=#000000}}

==The death of Moses==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|So Moses the servant of the LORD died in the land of Moab,|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,|color=#000000}}
