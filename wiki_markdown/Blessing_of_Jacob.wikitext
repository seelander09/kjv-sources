According to the [[w:documentary hypothesis|documentary hypothesis]], the [[w:Torah|Torah]] is composed from a number of originally independent sources joined by a [[w:redaction|redactor]]. One of these supposed sources is named the [[w:Jahwist|"Jahwist source"]], due to its preference of referring to God as [[w:Jahweh|Jahweh]] (usually translated as "The LORD"). This source contains within it two poems which are believed to have originally been separate documents. One of these poems (at Genesis 49:1-27) is known as the [[w:Blessing of Jacob|Blessing of Jacob]], and can be compared with a similar poem known as the [[w:Blessing of Moses|Blessing of Moses]].
