According to the
<a href="wikipedia:documentary_hypothesis" class="wikilink"
title="documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a>, the
<a href="wikipedia:Torah" class="wikilink" title="Torah">Torah</a> is
composed from a number of originally independent sources joined by a
<a href="wikipedia:redaction" class="wikilink"
title="redactor">redactor</a>. One of these supposed sources is named
the <a href="wikipedia:Jahwist" class="wikilink"
title="&quot;Jahwist source&quot;">"Jahwist source"</a>, due to its
preference of referring to God as
<a href="wikipedia:Jahweh" class="wikilink" title="Jahweh">Jahweh</a>
(usually translated as "The LORD"). This source contains within it two
poems which are believed to have originally been separate documents. One
of these poems (Gen 4:23-24) is known as the Song of Lamech.[^1]
