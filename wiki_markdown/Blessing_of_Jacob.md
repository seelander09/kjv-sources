According to the <a href="w:documentary_hypothesis" class="wikilink"
title="documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a>, the
<a href="w:Torah" class="wikilink" title="Torah">Torah</a> is composed
from a number of originally independent sources joined by a
<a href="w:redaction" class="wikilink" title="redactor">redactor</a>.
One of these supposed sources is named the
<a href="w:Jahwist" class="wikilink"
title="&quot;Jahwist source&quot;">"Jahwist source"</a>, due to its
preference of referring to God as
<a href="w:Jahweh" class="wikilink" title="Jahweh">Jahweh</a> (usually
translated as "The LORD"). This source contains within it two poems
which are believed to have originally been separate documents. One of
these poems (at Genesis 49:1-27) is known as the
<a href="w:Blessing_of_Jacob" class="wikilink"
title="Blessing of Jacob">Blessing of Jacob</a>, and can be compared
with a similar poem known as the
<a href="w:Blessing_of_Moses" class="wikilink"
title="Blessing of Moses">Blessing of Moses</a>.

does not reflect, in any way, the original numbering of the text, and
simply exists for the ease of modern readership*
