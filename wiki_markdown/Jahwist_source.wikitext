According to the [[w:documentary hypothesis|documentary hypothesis]], the [[w:Torah|Torah]] is composed from a number of originally independent sources joined by a [[w:redaction|redactor]]. One of these supposed sources is named the [[w:Jahwist|"Jahwist source"]], due to its preference of referring to God as [[w:Yahweh|Yahweh]] (usually translated as "The LORD").

==Creation==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| In the day that the LORD made the earth and the heavens,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| For the LORD had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And out of the ground made the LORD to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| The tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And out of the ground the LORD formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| And brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#000000| And the rib, which the LORD had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#000000| And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#000000| Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#000000| And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.}}

==The fall of Man==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD had made.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; }}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And they heard the voice of the LORD walking in the garden in the cool of the day:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD amongst the trees of the garden.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? }}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#000000| Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#000000| And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#000000| It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#000000| Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#000000| And thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#000000| And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#000000| And hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#000000| Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#000000| Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#000000| In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|31}}{{font|color=#000000| For out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|32}}{{font|color=#000000| And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|33}}{{font|color=#000000| Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD make coats of skins, and clothed them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|34}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|35}}{{font|color=#000000| And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|36}}{{font|color=#000000| Therefore the LORD sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|37}}{{font|color=#000000| And he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.}}

==Cain and Abel ==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| That Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| And I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#000000| And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#000000| And he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#000000| And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#000000| And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#000000| And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#000000| And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#000000| And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#000000| And Lamech said unto his wives,}} {{font|color=#FF0000|Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#FF0000| If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#000000| And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|31}}{{font|color=#000000| For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|32}}{{font|color=#000000| And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|33}}{{font|color=#000000|[And Enos begat a son.]|size=}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|34}}{{font|color=#000000|And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.}}

==The Nephilim==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000|There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men,  and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.}}

==The flood==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; for it repenteth me that I have made them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000|Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. And the LORD shut him in.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And the flood was forty days upon the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000|And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And the rain from heaven was restrained; and the waters returned from off the earth continually.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass at the end of forty days, also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000|And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#000000| And Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#000000| And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#000000| While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.}}

==The curse of Ham==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000|And Canaan saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.}}

==The tower of Babel==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: And now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abra[ha]m called on the name of the LORD.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Lot also, which went with Abra[ha]m, had flocks, and herds, and tents.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abra[ha]m's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abra[ha]m said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said unto Abra[ha]m, after that Lot was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And they took Lot, Abra[ha]m's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And there came one that had escaped, and told Abra[ha]m the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abra[ha]m.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And when Abra[ha]m heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And the king of Sodom said unto Abra[ha]m, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abra[ha]m said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abra[ha]m rich:}}

==Hagar and Ishmael ==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And Sara[h] said unto Abra[ha]m, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| But Abra[ha]m said unto Sara[h], Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sara[h] dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, Hagar, Sara[h]'s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sara[h].}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.}}

==Sodom and Gomorrah==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; That the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: And that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#000000| And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#000000| But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#000000| And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#000000| And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? Son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|31}}{{font|color=#000000| For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.}}

==Jacob and Esau==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.}} 

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.}}

==The covenant with Isaac==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.}}

==Isaac's wife as his sister==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.}}

==The wells of Isaac==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And he went up from thence to Beersheba.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.}}

==The blessing of Isaac==

{{font|1|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.|color=#000000}}

{{font|2|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:|color=#000000}}

{{font|3|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;|color=#000000}}

{{font|4|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.|color=#000000}}

{{font|5|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.|color=#000000}}

{{font|6|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,|color=#000000}}

{{font|7|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.|color=#000000}}

{{font|8|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.|color=#000000}}

{{font|9|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:|color=#000000}}

{{font|10|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.|color=#000000}}

{{font|11|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:|color=#000000}}

{{font|12|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.|color=#000000}}

{{font|13|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.|color=#000000}}

{{font|14|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.|color=#000000}}

{{font|15|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:|color=#000000}}

{{font|16|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:|color=#000000}}

{{font|17|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.|color=#000000}}

{{font|18|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?|color=#000000}}

{{font|19|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.|color=#000000}}

{{font|20|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.|color=#000000}}

{{font|21|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.|color=#000000}}

{{font|22|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.|color=#000000}}

{{font|23|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.|color=#000000}}

{{font|24|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.|color=#000000}}

{{font|25|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.|color=#000000}}

{{font|26|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.|color=#000000}}

{{font|27|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:|color=#000000}}

{{font|28|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:|color=#000000}}

{{font|29|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.|color=#000000}}

{{font|30|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.|color=#000000}}

{{font|31|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.|color=#000000}}

{{font|32|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.|color=#000000}}

{{font|33|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.|color=#000000}}

{{font|34|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.|color=#000000}}

{{font|35|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.|color=#000000}}

{{font|36|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?|color=#000000}}

{{font|37|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?|color=#000000}}

{{font|38|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.|color=#000000}}

{{font|39|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;|color=#000000}}

{{font|40|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.|color=#000000}}

==The exile of Jacob ==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And tarry with him a  few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?}}

==Jacob's dream==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000|And he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not. If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, then shall the LORD be my God.}}

==The sheep and the stone==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.}}
==The two wives of Jacob==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000|[And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.]}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.}}

==The blemished flock==

{{font|1|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.|color=#000000}}

{{font|2|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.|color=#000000}}

{{font|3|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.|color=#000000}}

{{font|4|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.|color=#000000}}

{{font|5|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.|color=#000000}}

{{font|6|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?|color=#000000}}

{{font|7|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.|color=#000000}}

{{font|8|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.|color=#000000}}

{{font|9|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.|color=#000000}}

{{font|10|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.|color=#000000}}

{{font|11|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.|color=#000000}}

{{font|12|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.|color=#000000}}

{{font|13|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.|color=#000000}}

{{font|14|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.|color=#000000}}

{{font|15|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.|color=#000000}}

{{font|16|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.|color=#000000}}

{{font|17|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.|color=#000000}}

{{font|18|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.}}

==Jacob's Reunion with Esau==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.}} 

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.|color=#000000}}

{{font|18|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.|color=#000000}}

{{font|19|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.|color=#000000}}

{{font|20|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.|color=#000000}}

{{font|21|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.|color=#000000}}

{{font|22|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.|color=#000000}}

{{font|23|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.|color=#000000}}

{{font|24|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. And he blessed him there.|color=#000000}}

{{font|25|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.|color=#000000}}

{{font|26|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.|color=#000000}}

{{font|27|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.|color=#000000}}

{{font|28|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.|color=#000000}}

{{font|29|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.|color=#000000}}

{{font|30|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.|color=#000000}}

{{font|31|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.|color=#000000}}

{{font|32|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.|color=#000000}}

{{font|33|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.|color=#000000}}

{{font|34|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.|color=#000000}}

{{font|35|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.|color=#000000}}

{{font|36|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.|color=#000000}}

{{font|37|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.|color=#000000}}

{{font|38|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.|color=#000000}}

{{font|39|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.|color=#000000}}

{{font|40|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.|color=#000000}}

{{font|41|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord.|color=#000000}}

{{font|42|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.|color=#000000}}

{{font|43|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.|color=#000000}}

==The rape of Dinah==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| [Shechem] took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| That two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?}}

==Reuben and Bilhah==

{{font|1|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.|color=#000000}}

{{font|2|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:|color=#000000}}

{{font|3|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.|color=#000000}}

{{font|4|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.|color=#000000}}

{{font|5|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.|color=#000000}}

{{font|6|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|[And Jacob came to] Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.|color=#000000}}

{{font|7|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.|color=#000000}}

{{font|8|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.|color=#000000}}

{{font|9|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Jacob set up a pillar, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.|color=#000000}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it.}}

==Joseph enslaved==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000|Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000|And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And his brethren envied him, and they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.}}

==Judah and Tamar==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, That he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; aor she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#000000| Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#000000| And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#000000| And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#000000| When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#000000| And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#000000| And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.}}

==The Egyptian's wife==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000|There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000|And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000| And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#000000| But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#000000| And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#000000| The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.}}

{{font|65|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?|color=#000000}}

{{font|66|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.|color=#000000}}

{{font|67|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.|color=#000000}}

{{font|68|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.|color=#000000}}

{{font|69|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.|color=#000000}}

{{font|70|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.|color=#000000}}

{{font|71|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.|color=#000000}}

{{font|72|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.|color=#000000}}

{{font|73|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.|color=#000000}}

{{font|74|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.|color=#000000}}

{{font|75|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.|color=#000000}}

{{font|76|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?|color=#000000}}

{{font|77|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.|color=#000000}}

{{font|78|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.|color=#000000}}

{{font|79|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:|color=#000000}}

{{font|80|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?|color=#000000}}

{{font|81|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.|color=#000000}}

{{font|82|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.|color=#000000}}

{{font|83|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.|color=#000000}}

{{font|84|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.|color=#000000}}

{{font|85|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.|color=#000000}}

{{font|86|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.|color=#000000}}

{{font|87|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?|color=#000000}}

{{font|88|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.|color=#000000}}

{{font|89|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.|color=#000000}}

{{font|90|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.|color=#000000}}

{{font|91|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?|color=#000000}}v

{{font|92|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.|color=#000000}}

{{font|93|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.|color=#000000}}

{{font|94|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.|color=#000000}}

{{font|95|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.|color=#000000}}

{{font|96|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.|color=#000000}}

{{font|97|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.|color=#000000}}

{{font|98|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.|color=#000000}}

{{font|99|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:|color=#000000}}

{{font|100|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:|color=#000000}}

{{font|101|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.|color=#000000}}

{{font|102|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;|color=#000000}}

{{font|103|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.|color=#000000}}

{{font|104|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.|color=#000000}}

{{font|105|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.|color=#000000}}

{{font|106|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.|color=#000000}}

{{font|107|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.|color=#000000}}

{{font|108|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.|color=#000000}}

{{font|109|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.|color=#000000}}

{{font|110|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.|color=#000000}}

{{font|111|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.|color=#000000}}

{{font|112|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.|color=#000000}}

{{font|113|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.|color=#000000}}

{{font|114|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.|color=#000000}}

{{font|115|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:|color=#000000}}

{{font|117|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.|color=#000000}}

{{font|118|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.|color=#000000}}

{{font|119|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.|color=#000000}}

{{font|120|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.|color=#000000}}

{{font|121|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.|color=#000000}}

{{font|122|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.|color=#000000}}

{{font|123|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;|color=#000000}}

{{font|124|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.|color=#000000}}

{{font|125|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.|color=#000000}}

{{font|126|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.|color=#000000}}

{{font|127|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.|color=#000000}}

{{font|128|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.|color=#000000}}

{{font|129|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.|color=#000000}}

{{font|130|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.|color=#000000}}

{{font|131|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,|color=#000000}}

{{font|132|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.|color=#000000}}

{{font|133|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:|color=#000000}}

{{font|134|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.|color=#000000}}

==Israel's migration to Egypt==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#000000| And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#000000| And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#000000| And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#000000| And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#000000| That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#000000| Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#000000| And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#000000| And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#000000| They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#000000| The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#000000| And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#000000| And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#000000|And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#000000| When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#000000| Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#000000| And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#000000| Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#000000| Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#000000| And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#000000| And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#000000| And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#000000| And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#000000| But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.}}

<small>{{font|5|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And the elders of Moab departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|21|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|22|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|23|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|24|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|25|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|26|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|27|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|28|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|29|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|30|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|33|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|44|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.|color=#000000}}

<small>{{font|45|color=#0000FF}}</small>{{font|And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.|color=#000000}}
