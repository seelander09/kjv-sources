According to the <a href="w:documentary_hypothesis" class="wikilink"
title="documentary hypothesis">documentary hypothesis</a>, the
<a href="w:torah" class="wikilink" title="torah">torah</a> was redacted
together from a number of earlier source texts. The largest of these is
referred to as the "<a href="w:Priestly_source" class="wikilink"
title="Priestly source">Priestly source</a>", due to its concentration
on details which would be of interest to the
<a href="w:Aaron" class="wikilink" title="Aaron">Aaronid</a> priesthood.

The reconstructed text of this source contains several elements which
are separable from the narrative, including several laws, and
descriptions of how rituals should be carried out. It is sometimes
believed that these were originally separate documents held as priestly
records, or simple observations. One of these separable elements is the
description of the borders of Canaan (expressed at
<a href="w:Book_of_numbers" class="wikilink" title="Numbers">Numbers</a>
34:2b-12):

Hazarenan:

And the east border

  
From Hazarenan to Shepham:

<!-- -->

  
And the coast goest down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of
Ain;

<!-- -->

  
And the border descendeth, to reach unto the side of the sea of
Chinnereth eastward:

<!-- -->

  
And the border goest down to Jordan, and the goings out of it is at the
salt sea:

This is the land with the coasts thereof round about.
