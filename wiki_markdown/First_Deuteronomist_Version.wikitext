<[[Bible, English, King James, According to the documentary hypothesis]] | [[Bible, English, King James, Documentary Hypothesis, Deuteronomist source|Deuteronomist source]]

According to the [[w:documentary hypothesis|documentary hypothesis]], the [[w:Torah|Torah]] is composed from a number of originally independent sources joined by a [[w:redaction|redactor]]. One of these supposed sources is named the [[w:Deuteronomist|"Deuteronomist"]], due to it composing the vast majority of the text of [[w:Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]. Under the usual form of the hypothesis, the deuteronomist text is believed to have come in two editions, the earlier one, known as "Dtr1", being written around the time of king [[w:Josiah|Josiah]] by someone from the same circle as [[w:Jeremiah|Jeremiah]].

There follows the reconstructed text of the original edition ("dtr1") of the deuteronomist source of the Torah, using the [[w:King James Version|King James Translation]]. 

Though considered to have been written as a coherent work by a single author, the text can be broken down into a number of components, some of which may derive from separate documents or observations.

==Part 1 - Leaving Horeb==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#0000FF| These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#0000FF| In the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#0000FF| (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#0000FF| That Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#0000FF| After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#0000FF| On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#0000FF| The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount: turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#0000FF| To the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Behold, I have set the land before you:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#0000FF| The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#0000FF| (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#0000FF| How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#0000FF| So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#008800| And I charged your judges at that time, saying,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#008800| Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great;}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|D}}{{font|color=#008800| And the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#008800| And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.}}

==Part 2 - The rebellion after the report of the spies==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Fear not, neither be discouraged.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And ye murmured in your tents, and said,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying,}}

::{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|i}}{{font|color=#0000FF| The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#0000FF| The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh;}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| He shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Thou also shalt not go in thither.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|D}}{{font|color=#0000FF| They shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|E}}{{font|color=#0000FF| But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Then ye answered and said unto me,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#0000FF| So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#0000FF| So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.}}

==Part 3 - The peaceful journey through the wilderness==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And we compassed mount Seir many days. And the LORD spake unto me, saying,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And command thou the people, saying,}}

::{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|i}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:}}

::{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|ii}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth;}}

::{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|iii}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.}}

::{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|iv}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.}}

::{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|v}}{{font|color=#0000FF| For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness:}}

::{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|vi}}{{font|color=#0000FF| These forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD said unto me,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession;}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#0000FF| The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|D}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|E}}{{font|color=#0000FF| The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime;}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|F}}{{font|color=#0000FF| But the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead;}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|G}}{{font|color=#0000FF| As Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|H}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#0000FF| For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#0000FF| So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#0000FF| That the LORD spake unto me, saying,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#0000FF| For I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#0000FF| (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#0000FF| A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#0000FF| As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)}}

==Part 4 - The conquest of Gilead==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#0000FF| This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#0000FF| (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;)}} 

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#0000FF| But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#0000FF| For the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD said unto me,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#0000FF| From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#0000FF| There was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD said unto me,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#0000FF| So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And we smote him until none was left to him remaining.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#0000FF| All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#0000FF| But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|31}}{{font|color=#0000FF| (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|32}}{{font|color=#0000FF| All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.}}
	
{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|33}}{{font|color=#0000FF| For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|34}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon?}} 

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|35}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|36}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|37}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|38}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|39}}{{font|color=#0000FF| All the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|40}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|41}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|42}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I gave Gilead unto Machir.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|43}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|44}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|45}}{{font|color=#0000FF| The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|46}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|47}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|48}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|49}}{{font|color=#0000FF| But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|50}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|52}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|51}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.}}

==Part 5 - The appointment of Joshua to replace Moses ==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| So shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| For what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#0000FF| I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#0000FF| But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|D}}{{font|color=#0000FF| But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|E}}{{font|color=#0000FF| For he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#0000FF| So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.}}

==Part 6 - Introduction to the laws==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#008800| Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#008800| For to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#008800| That ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#008800| Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#008800| For all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#008800| But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#008800| Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#008800| That ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#008800| Keep therefore and do them;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#008800| For this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#008800| Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#008800| For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#008800| And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#008800| Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#008800| Lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#008800| But teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#008800| Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#008800| Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#008800| That they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And ye came near and stood under the mountain;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And he wrote them upon two tables of stone.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#008800| And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#008800| That ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.}}

==Part 7 - The law against idolatry==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#008800| Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#008800| For ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#008800| Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#008800| The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#008800| The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#008800| And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#008800| Shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#008800| But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#008800| To be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#008800| Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#008800| And that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#008800| But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#008800| Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#008800| And make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#008800| For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.}}

==Part 8 - The argument that the LORD is God==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#008800| For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#008800| And ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#008800| Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#008800| Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#008800| By temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#008800| According to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#008800| Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#008800| Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#008800| And upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#008800| And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#008800| To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#008800| Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#008800| That it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#008800| And that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.}}

==Part 9 - The appointment of three cities of refuge==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#0000FF| That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.}}

==Part 10 - The introduction to the law==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#008800| And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#008800| These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#008800| On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#008800| Whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#008800| And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#008800| Which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#008800| From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#008800| And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.}}

==Part 11 - The Ten Commandments ==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#0000FF| The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#0000FF| The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#0000FF| The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#0000FF| (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#0000FF| For ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#0000FF| I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Thou shalt have none other gods before me.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#0000FF| For I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|D}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#0000FF| In it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|D}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates;}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|E}}{{font|color=#0000FF| That thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|F}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|G}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|H}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee;}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| That thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Thou shalt not kill.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Neither shalt thou commit adultery.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Neither shalt thou steal.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#0000FF| These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#008800| And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,)}} 

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#008800| That ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#008800| And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#008800| And we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#008800| Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#008800| For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#008800| Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#008800| And speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#008800| And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#008800| I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#008800| O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#008800| And keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|D}}{{font|color=#008800| Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.}}

==Part 12 - Order to obey the commands==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#008800| Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#008800| Which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#008800| That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#008800| Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#008800| As the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#008800| Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#008800| And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#008800| And shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#008800| And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#008800| To give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not, and houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#008800| And wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#008800| Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#008800| (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you)}} 

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#008800| Lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#008800| To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#008800| And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#008800| What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#008800| Then thou shalt say unto thy son,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#008800| We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#008800| And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#008800| And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|D}}{{font|color=#008800| And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|E}}{{font|color=#008800| That he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|F}}{{font|color=#008800| And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.}}

==Part 13 - Order to obliterate Canaan and its religion==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#008800| When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#008800| The Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#008800| Seven nations greater and mightier than thou;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#008800| And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#008800| Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#008800| For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#008800| So will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#008800| But thus shall ye deal with them;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#008800| For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#008800| The LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#008800| The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#008800| But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#008800| Hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#008800| Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#008800| Which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#008800| And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#008800| Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#008800| That the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#008800| And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#008800| Thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#008800| In the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#008800| And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#008800| But will lay them upon all them that hate thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#008800| Thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#008800| If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|31}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|32}}{{font|color=#008800| The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|33}}{{font|color=#008800| Whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|34}}{{font|color=#008800| Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|35}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|36}}{{font|color=#008800| And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|37}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|38}}{{font|color=#008800| But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|39}}{{font|color=#008800| And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|40}}{{font|color=#008800| There shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|41}}{{font|color=#008800| The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|42}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|43}}{{font|color=#008800| Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|44}}{{font|color=#008800| But thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.}}

==Part 14 - Further order to obey the commandments==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#008800| All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#008800| That ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#008800| To humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#008800| And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#008800| That he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#008800| Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#008800| Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#008800| For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#008800| A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#008800| A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#008800| A land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#008800| When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#008800| Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#008800| Which I command thee this day:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#008800| Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#008800| And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#008800| Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#008800| Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#008800| And drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#008800| Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#008800| That he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#008800| But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#008800| For it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.}}

==Part 15 - Instruction that Canaan is wicked==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#0000FF| To go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#0000FF| A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#0000FF| As a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#0000FF| So shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#0000FF| For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#0000FF| But for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#0000FF| But for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.}}

==Part 16 - Recollection of the golden calf==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#0000FF| From the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#0000FF| When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD said unto me,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves;}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| They are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#0000FF| So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#0000FF| I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#0000FF| For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#0000FF| But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#0000FF| I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob;}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|D}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|E}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say,}}

::{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|i}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them,}}

::{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|ii}}{{font|color=#0000FF| He hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|F}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#0000FF| At that time the LORD said unto me,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|31}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|32}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|33}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And there they be, as the LORD commanded me.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|34}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|35}}{{font|color=#0000FF| There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|36}}{{font|color=#0000FF| From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|37}}{{font|color=#0000FF| At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|38}}{{font|color=#0000FF| To stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|39}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|40}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|41}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|42}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|43}}{{font|color=#0000FF| That they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.}}

==Part 17 - Order to love God==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#008800| And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#008800| But to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#008800| To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#008800| Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#008800| Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#008800| Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#008800| For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#008800| A great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#008800| He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#008800| Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#008800| He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#008800| Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#008800| And now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#008800| Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#008800| And know ye this day:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#008800| For I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#008800| His greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, and his miracles, and his acts,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#008800| Which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#008800| And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#008800| How he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#008800| And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#008800| And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#008800| How the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#008800| And all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#008800| But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#008800| Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#008800| That ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#008800| And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#008800| A land that floweth with milk and honey.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|31}}{{font|color=#008800| For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|32}}{{font|color=#008800| From whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|33}}{{font|color=#008800| But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|34}}{{font|color=#008800| A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|35}}{{font|color=#008800| From the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|36}}{{font|color=#008800| And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|37}}{{font|color=#008800| To love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|38}}{{font|color=#008800| That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|39}}{{font|color=#008800| That thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|40}}{{font|color=#008800| And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|41}}{{font|color=#008800| Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|42}}{{font|color=#008800| And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|43}}{{font|color=#008800| And lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|44}}{{font|color=#008800| Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|45}}{{font|color=#008800| And bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|46}}{{font|color=#008800| And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|47}}{{font|color=#008800| And when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|48}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|49}}{{font|color=#008800| That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|50}}{{font|color=#008800| In the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|51}}{{font|color=#008800| For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|52}}{{font|color=#008800| To love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|53}}{{font|color=#008800| Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|54}}{{font|color=#008800| Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|55}}{{font|color=#008800| From the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|56}}{{font|color=#008800| There shall no man be able to stand before you:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|57}}{{font|color=#008800| For the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|58}}{{font|color=#008800| Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|59}}{{font|color=#008800| A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|60}}{{font|color=#008800| And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|61}}{{font|color=#008800| To go after other gods, which ye have not known.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|62}}{{font|color=#008800| And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|63}}{{font|color=#008800| That thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|64}}{{font|color=#008800| Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|65}}{{font|color=#008800| In the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|66}}{{font|color=#008800| For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|67}}{{font|color=#008800| And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.}}

==Part 18 - Order to have only one place of worship==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#008800| These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#008800| Which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#008800| Upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#008800| And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#008800| And ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#008800| But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#008800| Even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#008800| And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#008800| And your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#008800| And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#008800| For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#008800| But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#008800| And when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#008800| Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#008800| Thither shall ye bring all that I command you;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#008800| Your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#008800| And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#008800| Forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#008800| Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#008800| But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#008800| There thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#008800| Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#008800| According to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#008800| The unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#008800| Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|31}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|32}}{{font|color=#008800| Nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|33}}{{font|color=#008800| But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|34}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|35}}{{font|color=#008800| Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|36}}{{font|color=#008800| When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#008800| I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|37}}{{font|color=#008800| If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|38}}{{font|color=#008800| Then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|39}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|40}}{{font|color=#008800| Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|41}}{{font|color=#008800| Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|42}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|43}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|44}}{{font|color=#008800| When thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|45}}{{font|color=#008800| Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|46}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|47}}{{font|color=#008800| And the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|48}}{{font|color=#008800| Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|49}}{{font|color=#008800| When thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|50}}{{font|color=#008800| When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|51}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|54}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|55}}{{font|color=#008800| For even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#008800| For the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#008800| Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|C}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#008800| And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|D}}{{font|color=#008800| Of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#008800| Therefore I command thee this thing to day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#008800| And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#008800| Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|B}}{{font|color=#008800| And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#008800| It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#008800| For he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|49}}{{font|color=#008800| A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|50}}{{font|color=#008800| And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|51}}{{font|color=#008800| Which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|52}}{{font|color=#008800| And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|54}}{{font|color=#008800| And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|55}}{{font|color=#008800| In the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|56}}{{font|color=#008800| So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|57}}{{font|color=#008800| His eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|58}}{{font|color=#008800| So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|59}}{{font|color=#008800| Because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|60}}{{font|color=#008800| The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|61}}{{font|color=#008800| Her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|62}}{{font|color=#008800| And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|63}}{{font|color=#008800| For she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|64}}{{font|color=#008800| If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name,}}

:{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|A}}{{font|color=#008800| THE LORD THY GOD;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|65}}{{font|color=#008800| Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|66}}{{font|color=#008800| And of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|67}}{{font|color=#008800| Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|68}}{{font|color=#008800| Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|69}}{{font|color=#008800| Them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|70}}{{font|color=#008800| And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|71}}{{font|color=#008800| Because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.}}

==Part 76 - Closing summary of the law ==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#008800| These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#008800| Beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#008800| And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#008800| The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#008800| Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#008800| And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#008800| And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#008800| And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#008800| Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#008800| Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#008800| That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#008800| That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#008800| As he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#008800| Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#008800| But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#008800| (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#008800| And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#008800| Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#008800| Whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#008800| Lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|24}}{{font|color=#008800| And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|25}}{{font|color=#008800| I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|26}}{{font|color=#008800| The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|27}}{{font|color=#008800| And all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|28}}{{font|color=#008800| And the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|29}}{{font|color=#008800| The secret things belong unto the LORD our God:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|30}}{{font|color=#008800| But those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|31}}{{font|color=#008800| For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|32}}{{font|color=#008800| It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|33}}{{font|color=#008800| Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?}}

==Part 77 - Preparing for Canaan ==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|1}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|2}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|3}}{{font|color=#0000FF| I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|4}}{{font|color=#0000FF| The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|5}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|6}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|7}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|8}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|9}}{{font|color=#0000FF| For the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#0000FF| Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them;}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And thou shalt cause them to inherit it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#008800| And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#008800| Which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#008800| And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#008800| When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#008800| Thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#008800| Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#008800| That they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#008800| And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#008800| As long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.}}

==Part 78 - The death of Moses ==

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|10}}{{font|color=#008800| And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|11}}{{font|color=#008800| That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|12}}{{font|color=#008800| Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|13}}{{font|color=#008800| That it may be there for a witness against thee.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|14}}{{font|color=#008800| For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|15}}{{font|color=#008800| Ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|16}}{{font|color=#008800| And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|17}}{{font|color=#008800| And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|18}}{{font|color=#008800| Which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|19}}{{font|color=#008800| For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|20}}{{font|color=#008800| And through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|21}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|22}}{{font|color=#0000FF| In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|23}}{{font|color=#0000FF| And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.}}
