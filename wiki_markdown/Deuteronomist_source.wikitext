According to the [[wikipedia:documentary hypothesis|documentary hypothesis]], the [[wikipedia:Torah|Torah]] is composed from a number of originally independent sources joined by a [[wikipedia:redaction|redactor]]. One of these supposed sources is named the [[wikipedia:Deuteronomist|"Deuteronomist source"]], due to its comprising the majority of the book of Deuteronomy. This prose source contains within it a law code and a poem thought to have been earlier separate sources - The Song of Moses.

There follows the reconstructed text of the Deuteronomist Source, using the [[wikipedia:King James Version|King James Translation]] of the Torah.

{{font|3|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:|color=#008800}}

{{font|4|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.|color=#008800}}

{{font|5|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.|color=#008800}}

{{font|6|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:|color=#008800}}

{{font|7|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.|color=#008800}}

{{font|9|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?|color=#008800}}

{{font|10|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.|color=#008800}}

{{font|11|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.|color=#008800}}

{{font|12|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.|color=#008800}}

{{font|13|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.|color=#008800}}

{{font|14|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.|color=#008800}}

{{font|15|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.|color=#008800}}

{{font|16|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.|color=#008800}}

{{font|17|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.|color=#008800}}

{{font|18|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.|color=#008800}}

{{font|19|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.|color=#008800}}

{{font|20|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:|color=#008800}}

{{font|21|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.|color=#008800}}

{{font|22|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.|color=#008800}}

{{font|23|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:|color=#008800}}

{{font|24|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.|color=#008800}}

{{font|25|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.|color=#008800}}

{{font|26|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.|color=#008800}}

{{font|27|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;|color=#008800}}

{{font|28|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.|color=#008800}}

{{font|29|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,|color=#008800}}

{{font|30|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.|color=#008800}}

{{font|31|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,|color=#008800}}

{{font|32|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers.|color=#008800}}

{{font|33|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.|color=#008800}}

{{font|34|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.|color=#008800}}

{{font|35|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.|color=#008800}}

{{font|36|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.|color=#008800}}

{{font|37|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.|color=#880000}}

{{font|38|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.|color=#880000}}

{{font|39|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.|color=#880000}}

{{font|40|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.|color=#008800}}

{{font|42|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.|color=#008800}}

{{font|43|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.|color=#008800}}

{{font|44|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the LORD spake unto me, saying,|color=#008800}}

{{font|45|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.|color=#008800}}

{{font|46|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:|color=#008800}}

{{font|47|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.|color=#008800}}

{{font|48|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.|color=#008800}}

{{font|49|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.|color=#008800}}

{{font|50|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.|color=#008800}}

{{font|51|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.|color=#008800}}

{{font|52|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.|color=#008800}}

{{font|55|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.|color=#008800}}

{{font|56|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.|color=#008800}}

{{font|57|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.|color=#008800}}

{{font|58|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,|color=#008800}}

{{font|59|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.|color=#008800}}

{{font|60|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;|color=#008800}}

{{font|61|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.|color=#008800}}

{{font|62|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.|color=#008800}}

{{font|65|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.|color=#008800}}

{{font|66|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:|color=#008800}}

{{font|70|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.|color=#008800}}

{{font|71|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.|color=#008800}}

{{font|72|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.|color=#008800}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|83}}{{font|color=#800080| And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|84}}{{font|color=#800080| Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|88}}{{font|color=#800080| And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|89}}{{font|color=#800080| And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.}}

{{font|size=smaller|color=#0000FF|102}}{{font|color=#880000| And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.}}

{{font|8|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.|color=#008800}}

{{font|7|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;|color=#008800}}

==First Introduction to the Song of Moses ==

{{font|1|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.|color=#008800}}

{{font|2|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.|color=#008800}}

{{font|3|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.|color=#008800}}

{{font|4|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.|color=#008800}}

== Second Introduction to the Song of Moses ==
{{font|1|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,|color=#800080}}

{{font|2|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,|color=#800080}}

{{font|4|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?|color=#800080}}

{{font|5|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.|color=#800080}}

{{font|6|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.|color=#800080}}

{{font|7|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.|color=#800080}}

== The Song of Moses ==
{{font|1|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|2|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|3|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|4|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|5|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|6|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|7|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|8|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|9|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|10|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|11|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|12|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|13|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|14|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|15|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|16|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|17|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|18|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|19|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|20|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|21|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|22|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|23|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|24|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|25|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|26|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|27|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|28|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|29|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|30|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|31|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|32|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|33|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|34|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|36|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|37|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|38|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|39|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|41|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.|color=#00FF88}}

{{font|42|size=smaller|color=#0000FF}}{{font|I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.|color=#00FF88}}
